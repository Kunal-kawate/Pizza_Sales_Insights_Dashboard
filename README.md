# Pizza Sales Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard for analyzing pizza sales data. The dashboard provides valuable insights into various aspects of the pizza business, such as most ordered pizzas, total sales, peak order times, and hot-selling pizza categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes the following tables:
- **OrderDetails**: Contains details about each order, including quantity and pizza IDs.
- **Orders**: Includes order-level data such as date and time.
- **Pizzas**: Maps pizza IDs to their respective pizza types.
- **PizzaTypes**: Categorizes pizzas into types and categories.

## Key Features
1. **Most Ordered Pizza**: Identifies the pizza with the highest number of orders.
2. **Total Sales**: Displays the overall revenue generated.
3. **Most Ordered Day**: Highlights the day of the week with the most orders.
4. **Date Slicer**: Allows filtering data by specific date ranges.
5. **Hot-Selling Pizza Category**: Shows the top-performing pizza categories based on sales.
6. **Most Orders by Time Zone**: Analyzes orders based on time zones such as morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

## Visualizations
To present these insights, the following charts and visuals were used:
- **Stacked Column Chart**: For displaying sales distribution.
- **Clustered Bar Chart**: To compare orders by categories and time zones.
- **Line Chart**: For visualizing trends over time.
